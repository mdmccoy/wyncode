Oh so many questions.

What is the relation between "World" and "Election"? Are they both classes

How do I lay out this menu structure? Does it exist in World or in the Election?

I think I'm supposed to call one menu from the other... doesn't that mean I'm going to have a huge call stack eventually?

Is there a way to clear that out?

How do I lay out my tests?

It doesn't seem like any of my objects have much behavior. What do I test for?
